			<p id="Quote1">"The Love of a family is life's greatest blessings"<p>
			<p id="Quote2">"Family is the best thing you could ever wish for. They are there for you
			during the ups and downs and love you no matter what"</p>
			<p>These quotes symbolize the many blessings and the greatness of having a 
			family and how they help us in many ways. Where our future and past successes but also failures
			are influenced by our loved ones. As well as many who do become great successors, thank their family
			to how they have become.With the Montoya family, we are able to
			see how they have influenced and guided the Mya & Myka to their great success. There is no
			doubt we see giving many thanks for their mom & dad. Therefore, 
			their family is most important to their greatest rewards and accomplishments.</p>
