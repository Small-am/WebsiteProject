			<p>Montoya'z Hollywood Break In, after their announcement of their plans to move to Los Angeles, California,
			they gained from Facebook a "Facebook watch series". Started October 2017, with currently 50 episodes and continuing.
			The series
			follows the Twins' transition from their small town of Amarillo, Texas to the big city of
			Los Angeles, California. Through their episodes, and almost 600k followers and growing, we
			watch as the Mya & Myka get exposure to the social media life in L.A and the many celebrities
			they meet along the way. As well as experience being in one of the largest cities in the U.S. As they are only 18 years old, the twins' path of success will continue
			to grow. On the other hand, we see the things and actions they do throughout their days, but also spend some quality time
			with their family as well. Meaning they never forget about what is important to them, family.</p>
